## Bar Scheduling Simulation

To improve order processing efficiency, this project models the process of arranging drink orders at a bar. The simulation tests a number of scheduling algorithms to discover the best approach for handling the bar's orders.

## Running the Simulation

$ make // for compilation
$ make FCFS // for running the first algorithm
$ make SJF // for running the second algorithm

## Output:

its different text files for turnaround time , waiting time , and response time.
